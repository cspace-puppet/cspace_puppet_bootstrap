bootstrap
=========

Bootstrapping to get Puppet, the CollectionSpace Puppet modules, and their respective dependencies,
along with the Hiera key/value store, onto a host.

**Please make changes on the appropriate branch for the CollectionSpace
version to be installed**: e.g. `v4.2`, `v4.1`. And create new branches
for new CollectionSpace versions. (The `master` branch is now deprecated.)
